 Choose Your SDG and Problem

Pick one SDG and a specific problem within it. Examples:

SDG 3 (Health): Predict disease outbreaks using health data.

SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities): Optimize public transport routes with clustering.

SDG 13 (Climate Action): Forecast carbon emissions using regression.

2. Select an ML Approach

Supervised Learning: Predict outcomes (e.g., crop yields for SDG 2: Zero Hunger).

Unsupervised Learning: Cluster data (e.g., group regions by pollution levels for SDG 6: Clean Water).

Reinforcement Learning: Simulate sustainable resource allocation (e.g., energy distribution).

3. Dataset & Tools

Datasets: Use free, open-source data (e.g., World Bank Open Data, UN SDG Database, or Kaggle).

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.

4. Build Your Model

Preprocess Data: Clean, normalize, and split data.

Train Model: Use techniques like decision trees, CNNs, or NLP (e.g., sentiment analysis of social media for SDG 5: Gender Equality).

Evaluate: Apply metrics (accuracy, MAE, F1-score) and visualize results.

5. Ethical Reflection

How might bias in your data affect outcomes?

How does your solution promote fairness and sustainability?

Deliverables

Code: A Python notebook or script with comments explaining your workflow.

Report: A 1-page summary of:

SDG problem addressed.

ML approach used (e.g., "K-means clustering for urban waste analysis").

Results and ethical considerations.

Presentation: A 5-minute demo showcasing your model’s impact.

Example Projects

SDG 7 (Clean Energy): Predict solar energy potential using weather data (supervised learning).

SDG 4 (Education): Cluster students by learning patterns to recommend resources (unsupervised learning).

SDG 15 (Life on Land): Use CNNs to detect deforestation in satellite images.

Stretch Goals

Integrate real-time data via APIs (e.g., weather or social media feeds).

Deploy your model as a web app (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit).

Compare multiple ML algorithms to optimize performance.
